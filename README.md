# Solidity-Tinkering
The point of this repository is to store most of my work while I am learning smart contracts development.
For this repository I will be using Hardhat with a few plugins.

## Contracts
This directory contains all the contracts

## Coverage
Contains the code coverage test results obtained from the hardhat plugin

## Scripts
Contains every scripts that can be used, for instance: for contract deployment, testing how MerkleTrees works or minting NFT

## Test
Directory where every test for the written contracts will be put. Tests are written in JavaScript using Chai framework. Used in generating coverage reports
